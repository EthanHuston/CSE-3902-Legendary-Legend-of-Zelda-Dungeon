# LegendOfZelda.Link.Item
Holds the logic for all items that Link uses. LinkSpawnedItems is the container class that holds items that are currently spawned.

---
TODO: 
- Generalize items so any spawned item can be put into this class (whether they are from Link or an NPC)
- After moving these to generic spawned item interface, make a big spawned items container stored in Game1 (or somewhere similar)
