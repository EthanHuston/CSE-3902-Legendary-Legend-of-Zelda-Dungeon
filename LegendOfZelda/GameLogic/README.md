# LegendOfZelda.GameLogic
Holds all logic needed to run the game, like GameState, and a spawnable manager.

---
### TODO:
- Add more implementations of IGameState, like PauseState, GameLostState, GameWonState, etc.
- Assign different keyboard, mouse, game pad controllers to each different GameState to prevent buttons from being pressed that shouldn't be pressed in a specific state
