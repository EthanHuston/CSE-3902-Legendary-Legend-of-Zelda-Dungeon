# Bugs

### Sprint 5
For this Sprint, after testing we have not encountered any major or minor bugs in the game after adding the new features for Sprint 5.
Since our implementation from Sprint 4 did not have any known bugs either all debugging that occurred in this Sprint was related to new features which we were able to handle relatively easily as they arose during development.

### From Sprint 4
- There were no prior bugs from Sprint 4 to be fixed this sprint.
