# Moving Forward
### Refactoring
We feel that our team ended up with a very well refined project. Our code follows many of the software design practices we learned in class, so our code overall 
has good readability and maintainability; displaying high cohesion and low coupling. Although most of our code is solid, there is one major problem we ran into during this sprint: our code requires that the multiplayer and single player HUDs must be the same size. While implementing multiplayer, we decided to make the 
HUD taller to make room for both player's stats. However, our constants are created based off the HUD height and there is no way to change the constants during 
runtime. As our team moves forward beyond this class, this is an area we could come back to and refractor.

### Moving Forward
As mentioned above, our project is pretty well implemented and does not need much refactoring. However after seeing the other team's creative additions to their projects, our team felt inspired to implement more unique features to our game. So even after this class ends, there are endless possibilities to the new features 
we could add.
