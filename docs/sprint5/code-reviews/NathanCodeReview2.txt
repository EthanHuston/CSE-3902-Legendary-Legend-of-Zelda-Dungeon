Readability
The class itself is very short and to the point. Each method and variable name conveys its purpose to the reader; understanding where everything is at and its
place in the class. In tandem with its length, it helps the reader by making the logic easy to understand. Overall, this class has high readability.
Maintainability
Aspects of this room could easily be changed if an error was found. The same could be said if an addition was to be made in the future of this project. Everything
has a low dependency from each other, making the class' maintainability quite high. This is due to its length as well; naturally a mostly empty room is open for
more possibilities.
