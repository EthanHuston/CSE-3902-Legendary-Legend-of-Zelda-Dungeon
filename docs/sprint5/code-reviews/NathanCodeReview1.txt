Readability
This class, while lengthy in some methods, is quite good in terms of its readability. Variable and method names give clear indication on what their designated role
is for the class. Also, repitiion of certain actions help guide the reader towards some of the logic for implementation. Readers can then note that collections are
written in a context to clearly see each componenet clearly. Overall, this code has high readability.
Maintainability
In terms of future additions to the class as a whole, it clearly shows good maintainability. Additions in each of the mapping collections can easily be added with
minimal interference. This can also be said for maintenance on existing code. Evereything is clear cut, so a removal of one feature does not effect the other.
