Readability
This class is similar to many of the other game states but is actually functionally simpler as it doesn't have to worry about changing to multiple different states.
Because the state is far simpler the readability is very good, the methods are extremely short and the variable names are equally descriptive of their purpose.
Maintainability
This class is very maintainable as well as it follows the basic structure of the other game states structure of this class is highly maintainable and easy to adapt to future changes even if there aren't many changes coming up for the project. Many of the changes made for this sprint revolved around swift and adaptable changes at runtime and this class is no different.
