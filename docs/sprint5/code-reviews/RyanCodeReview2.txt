Readability
Very good. All the methods are simple and straight forward. If any method gets too complicated, it is split off into helper methods, like in InitEnemyList.
Maintainability
Maintainability is also pretty good. Banner makes use of a few outside classes, but not too many. Maintainability could be improved by using a constant on lines 28 and 29, but this is nothing too major.
