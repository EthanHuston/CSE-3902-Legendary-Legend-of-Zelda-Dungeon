Sprint 5
Ethan's Changes for Link and Enemy Sprites
Ethan Hudson
10 Minutes
Readability and Maintainability
For the sprite changes Ethan made during this sprint, he didn't have to make any new classes. Instead, he had to change the sprite classes for link and the enemies
to allow them to switch sprite images based on user input. This involved re-assigning the sprite variables in the sprite classes and using a different scalar constant,
as the new sprites were different sizes from the the Legend of Zelda sprites. This added some slightly more complex logic to the sprite classes, which effects
readability and maintainability. However, these classes are still easy to read and maintain.
