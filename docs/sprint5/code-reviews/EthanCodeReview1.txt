Readability
The readability for this class is very goodf as the class contains ony 3 methods and all fields within the class are well named to describe their purpose.
Furthermore there is limited logic found in this class so understanding what is happening is very easy as well.
Maintainability
This class is also very maintainable, even though this is the final sprint and the chance of changes occuring to the project are slim, this class 
doesn't rely heavily on any other classes and as said before is very simple so any possible changes in the future would be rather simple to implement on this class.
