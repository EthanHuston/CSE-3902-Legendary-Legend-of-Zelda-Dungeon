# Team Reflection and Agile Analysis
Sprint 5 started on 11/17 and went all the way through 12/04. While the first week still consisted of planning (as with all the previous sprints up to this point),
the group had a fairly good idea of what our goals for Sprint 5 were going to be. However, with a combination of a variety of events (holidays, exams for other
classes, other assignments in general, life, etc.), Sprint 5 took a lot longer to actually get started than the group offically intended. As seen on the burnout
chart [LINK BURNOUT CHART], the pacing of tackeling the tasks this sprint were discombobulated. While our team doesn't believe this could have been avoided, the
drastic nature of the chart itself could have been lessened to a more suitable degree (but hindsight is 20/20).

In a better light, the team has finely tuned its communication issues with the documentation. Planning was well organized which, in turn, led to a better
performance when writing the sprint's qualities and aspects. The team also continued to have a good distribution of tasks (which can be seen on the story boards
[LINK THE STORY BOARDS]) between each member, meetings were held with 100% attendance always, and debugging was met with high group involvement. Even the workload
of this sprint was accuratly predicted (which was an issue our team had in Sprint 4). Without the timing issue on the board, I'd say our team kept the group
mistakes to an alltime minimum.

In the end, through the naturally occuring highs and lows of any team project cycle, we believe that our end product speaks for itself as one of the best Legend
of Zelda implementations in the class. Without a solid team foundation during its development, it would have never ended up the way it did.
