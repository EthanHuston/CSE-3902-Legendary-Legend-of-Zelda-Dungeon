## General Notes
Overall, Sprint 2 went okay. We did not plan out the tasks and timing all that great, which is discussed in more depth below. A lot of the tasks/stories took longer than expected, as seen in the [burndown chart](BurndownChart.PNG). As a team, we talked about how we will be making changes to our planning process and implementing these changes in Sprint 3, which we summarized in [Moving Forward.md](Moving-Forward.md).
