# Team Reflection and Agile Analysis
Sprint 2 started on 9/5, but we did not get a good start on planning until 9/15. When we met on 9/15, we set up a repo on GitHub. On 9/17, we decided to use Azure Boards as our issue tracker/Agile tool. This is when we actually created the stories and tasks.

In addition, we underestimated how long the stories would take. Initially, we planned to have the code written and merged to master branch by Sunday, 9/27. That would give us all week, 9/28-10/4 to review and clean up code as well as debug. However, as stated previously, stories took longer than initially planned, so we were unable to merge them to master until 10/3. Once merged the team worked together to resolve all logical errors including animation problems and sprite sizes.

As seen in the [burndown chart](BurndownChart.PNG), we officially finished all tasks and stories on 10/5.
