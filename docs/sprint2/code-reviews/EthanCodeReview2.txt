Sprint 2
LinkPlayer.cs
Ryan Stuckey
15 minutes
Readability:
The readability of Ryans code for LinkPlayer is great, many of the methods are very short and simple allowing for quick understanding
of their responsibilties and functionality. He implemented the State pattern very well to keep the bulk of logic code in many places 
so as not to clutter any one method. Overall very clean code.
Maintainability:
The maintainability of the code is also fairly good as well. Given that there is extensive use of constants for quick global changes 
in the project if the group needs them. Also, he has essentially provided link with full functionality minus the required collision detection to be added in Sprint3,
So the code will not have to be altered too extensivly for the upcoming sprints and is also in a good spot to have collisioon detection added in later. Similarly
LinkPlayer is a part of IPlayer, meaning potential multiplayer in Sprint5 is also just a few steps away.
