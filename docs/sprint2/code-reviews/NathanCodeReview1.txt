Sprint 2
Skeleton.cs, SkeletonSprite.cs

15 Minutes
Readability:
Overall both files are great. Methods are kept as short as possible (Update() method for Skeleton.cs definitely was handled well in this regard by using
helper methods). On top of the briefness, it is clear to the reader what functions are being perofrmed on each line. Logic choices for the RNG are clearly
labeled as well.
Maintainability:
The only apperent issue with the maintainability of the code is the advent of collision handeling in the next sprint (Sprint 3). There may need to be
some overhall on certain aspects of the postioning for Skeleton. Other than that, both classes look great in this regard.
