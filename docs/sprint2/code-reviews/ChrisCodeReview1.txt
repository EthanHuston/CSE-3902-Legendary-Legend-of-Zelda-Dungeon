Readability:
Your code is clean and your variable names are specific and concise which makes your code easy to read.
For Bat.cs in the Update() method, consider moving the logic that updates the bat's position into a helper method like you did with ChooseDirection() and CheckBounds() to make Update() a little easier to understand.
BatSprite.cs looks good.
Maintainability:
It might be a good idea to use the variables in the constants class for the min and max values for X and Y incase we change the screen size.
