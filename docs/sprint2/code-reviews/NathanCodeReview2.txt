Sprint 2
LinkPlayer.cs

Readability:
This was very well done in terms of readability. Everything is well-named and clearly conveys on what that thing is supposed to do. A good example of this
can be found in the constructer; simple on what constitutes Link as a IPlayer. Methods are also very short and to the point.
Maintainability:
As with other class implementations for Sprint 2, the main issue comes up when collision detection gets introduced. This is especially apparent with Link,
as this is the main way the player interacts with the game. Other than that notion, everything seems to be in order when looking at LinkPlayer.cs for
maintainability.
