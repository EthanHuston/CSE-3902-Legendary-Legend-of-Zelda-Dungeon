Readability:
Your code is clean and your variable names are specific and concise which makes your code easy to read.
For FairySprite.cs in the Update() method, consider moving the logic that moves the fairy's position into a helper method like you 
did with ChooseDirection() and CheckBounds() to make Update() a little easier to understand.
Maintainability:
Consider using the variables in the constants class for the min and max values for X and Y incase we change the screen size.
You may want to move the logic that deals with the fairy's movement into the Fairy class instead of the FairySprite class because
the FairySprite class should only deal with animating the sprite. Then when you call fairySprite.Draw() in the Fairy class, you
just pass the x and y values as parameters.
