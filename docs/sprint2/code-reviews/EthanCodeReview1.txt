Sprint 2
MapSprite.cs and Map.cs

10 minutes
Readability:
Readability of the classes is great, since logic for the Map and Map Sprites are very simple there is not much extra code needed
Maintainability:
Maintainabilty of the code can be interpreted from the standpoint of collision handling needing to be implemented for Sprint3, these classes
may need some changes when this occurs so that the location logic of the Map can be handled correctly.
