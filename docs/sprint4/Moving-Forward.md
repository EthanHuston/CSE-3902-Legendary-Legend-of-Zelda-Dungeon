# Moving Forward
### Agile and Team Planning
Moving foraward for Sprint 5 our team believes we have some minor improvments to be made in time management. Great strides have been made in comparison to Sprints 2 and 3 where many major design elements were still being worked on close to the deadline. However, this sprint produced different results. While we were still working up until the deadline, the work being done was minor changes to improve the game experience instead of major changes to actually make the game function.

For Sprint 5 we hope to replicate our success from this sprint, and improve upon our weaknesses, especially given the shortened time period for completion. Sprint 5 will be a challenge given the upcoming final exams, but the team is prepared to make the most of our ideas for Sprint 5.

### Refactoring
Similar to Sprint 3, refactoring was a huge part of our success in this sprint. By utilizing Absract classes, properties, and inheritance we were able to streamline our implementations of new features and futureproof the game for our upcoming changes for Sprint 5. We are very happy with the current state of our classes as most of the important ones are clean and simple. For the classes where this is hard to accomplish, we believe we have done the best with what we were given and tried to split classes up with helper methods to make readability and maintainabilty much higher.

# Sprint 5 Plans
For Sprint 5, we were brainstorming on some features to potentially add. This includes local multiplayer, new items, and even a potential global sprite change. Many of these changes should be fairly simple to implement given the work we have already put in to making them possible. We already have made efforts to make multiplayer possible with a list of Players intead of simply one intance of Link, and all sprites in the game are made via SpriteFactories which could allow for easy swapping to different sprites. The team is looking forward to adding these new features and hopes the hard work we put forth this semester is shown in our final product come the end of Sprint 5.
