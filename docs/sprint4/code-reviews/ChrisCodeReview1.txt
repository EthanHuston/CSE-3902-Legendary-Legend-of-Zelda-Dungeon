Readability
The readability for this class is good. Each method is very short and the variable names are self explanatory 
so it is pretty easy to understand what this class is doing.
Maintainability
The maintainability of this class is good for this project. The the only issue I can see with this class is we would 
have to add some code if we implemented new items. However, this is fine for the state of the project right now.
