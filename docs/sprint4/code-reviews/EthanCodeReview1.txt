Readability
The readability for this class is very well done, being a state it only has to worry about its own workload and nothing else.
The methods are short, the update method is the longest, but its is neatly separated into phases so it is still very simple.
Overall an easy class to read, and everything makes sense within.
Maintainability
The maintainability of this code is fairly good as well. Given this is the game winning state, there shouldn't be any changes needed later on. 
If something needs to be changed later on then the class is simple enough that this will still be easy to maintain through any and all changes needed.
