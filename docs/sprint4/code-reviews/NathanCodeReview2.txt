Readability
This class has really good readability (which is not surprising given who wrote this class). First off, this class is really short; in turn having really short
methods. For what this class is in charge of, this is really coo1. Also, each of the methods and variables have really good names to tell the reader what they
are doing throughout the code. Overall, this was really well done in terms of readability.
Maintainability
Again, the writer of the code knocked it out of the parks in terms of maintainability. If the group wanted to implement a different system for the item menu, or
rather add onto its current form, it would be super easy to do. Everything is compact and separate from each other, which makes for great coupling. Overall, this
was very well done.
