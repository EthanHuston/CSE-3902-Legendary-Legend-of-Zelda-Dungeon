Readability
The readability for this class is very good. Implementing the AbstractGameState class makes this class shorter and easier to understand. 
Also, the variable and method names are easy to understand which helps the reader understand the function of this class.
Maintainability
The maintainability of this class is very good as well. Again, implementing the AbstractGameState class makes this class shorter and easier to update in the future.
Also, using the classes like inventoryMenu and mapMenu helps to simplify this class and lower coupling, which makes it easier to maintain.
