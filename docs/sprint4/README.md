# docs/sprint4
## General Notes
Overall this sprint went better than sprint 3. We did work up until the due date, but we also implemented more features relative to sprint 3. As we implemented new features, we found that our maintainability that we had from previous sprints allowed us to implement new feature relatively easily.
