# Bugs
For the most part everything works pretty good. However, we did have some issues with animations as well as functionality:
### Sprint 3
- In Room 1, bats slowly glitch off the screen; issue lies with how we are handling wall collisions for bat
- Goriya movement logic is acting strange; they get stuck in the corners and room is too easy as they don't throw the boomerang at Link
- If you just tap Link's movement keys repeatedly, he will alternate between walking and animating
### Sprint 2
- [[open]: ](../sprint2/Bugs.md)Fireball sprite animates incorrectly when shot from Aquamentus
- [[open]: ](../sprint2/Bugs.md)Link flashes slightly when walking 
- [[open]: ](../sprint2/Bugs.md)Sprites are all different size (ex: Link is small while enemies are huge) - implement sprite scaling functionality and constants to easily change this 
- [[open]: ](../sprint2/Bugs.md)Some of the enemies will go offscreen after some time; unsure of the cause of this but it needs fixed 
- [[open]: ](../sprint2/Bugs.md)The SpikeTrap Enemy movement logic is not behaving as intended, needs to be revisited or reworked. 
- [[open]: ](../sprint2/Bugs.md)Link walks too far when you just tap the walk 
- [[open]: ](../sprint2/Bugs.md)Link "slides on ice" when you press two direction buttons at the same time
