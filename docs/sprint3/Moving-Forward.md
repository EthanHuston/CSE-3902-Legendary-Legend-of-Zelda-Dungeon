# Moving Forward
### Agile and Team Planning

For Sprint 4 and onward, our team needs to do a better job capitalizing on the first week of the Sprint cycle. Even though it was mostly an issue this week due to a large workload outside the scope of this class (midterms and such, which can be seen on the [burndown chart](BurndownChart.PNG)), time management between team members still could have been handled better. However, in terms of planning task completion time, we believe that our team has improved exponentially when compared to Sprint 2. Issues with the Azure Boards this sprint came down to mostly overloading tasks rather than a lack of awareness to their completion times.

Add something about end project + debugging here.
