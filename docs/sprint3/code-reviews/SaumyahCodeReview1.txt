The collision detection looks nice with the if-else statements, and you check every possibility (with the spike trap that is). 
The movement of the traps seem fluid, and the despawn method works as intended.
You have a lot of methods, but with teh amount of work the traps must do, it is reasonable. The code for this class looks good.
