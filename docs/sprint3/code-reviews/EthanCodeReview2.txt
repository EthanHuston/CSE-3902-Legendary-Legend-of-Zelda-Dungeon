Readability
The readability of this file could be a little better, however the nature of a text parser that must deal with how many entities there are in a room
it will be hard to condense all the logic needed easily. So given the task at hand, i believe this code is not too hard to read. The most confusing parts is
the initial text parsing, after this the code is essentially one large switch case to differentiate between what needs to be spawned in the current room.
Maintainability
This code's maintainability is fairly good, potential changes needed in the future that apply to this code would be adding new items, enemies, or roo types. 
With a change like this we would simply need to add a new case in the switch and a new acronym in the text files to denote this new entity. Since this code
is just a text reader, needing to change the specific functionality will be unlikley, so the state of this CSVReader is good for where we are in the project.
