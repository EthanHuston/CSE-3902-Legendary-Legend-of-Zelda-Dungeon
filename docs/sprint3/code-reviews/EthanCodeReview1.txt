Readability
The readability of this file is very good, the methods are all short, and the longer ones are simply long
becasue they have loops in them that take up space. Overall its an easy file to read through and understand,
all of the names are simple, describing exatly what they do/are. When looking at this file, you can also decipher our logic
for collisions in our game. We decided on a top down approach to handling collisions, Link having priority and needing to be checked against everything
and then trickling down with less and less needing to be checked.
Maintainability
Maintaining this code should also be very easy and simple. The code is already primed for a potential multiplayer addition in Sprint 5 with the for each 
IPlayer in the player list. Beyond this, with such a simplified file for collision managing, when errors and bugs arise it will be much simpler to find them.
The maintainability of this code goes hand in hand with its readability, it shouldnt need to be changed much if at all, but if it must the code is simple 
enough to adapt to our needs.
