Readability
Overall, these files are fairily easy to understand/comprehend. The method names give clear indication to what is going on and what they are dealing with in that
instance. Also, the variable names (such as textureMapRow) give a clear picture to the reader on what they are storing. Other than the draw methods, each method
is short and to the point. When looking at the draw method, however, the if-else chain could not be avoided...so I do not blame the programmer for using it. Other
than that, each file has great readability.
Maintainability
The maintainabiliy of these files also seem to be quite good. As Sprint 4 deals with room transitions and such, these files are already able to accept the logical
changes needed to help the project make that transition. Also, as stated before, with such good readability, there is a lot more ease to making a larger overall
change (say in Sprint 5) if needed. Ergo, this code can adapt. Overall, these files demonstate good maintainability as well.
