Sprint 3
Skeleton.cs (Updated)

Readability
This class' readability is very good. Each method is given a name that clearly tells the reader what it is doing (such as ResetPosition()), while also having each
method be short and to the point. The branching in Update() and Move() is easy to follow; the reader can clearly see what case is called with that condition. In
tandem with this, each of the variables are named really well - as they clearly convey to the reader what is being stored in them (such as upDown and leftRight).
Overall, this class provides great readability.
Maintainability
Luckily, the way the enemies where designed for this project provide an easy "route" to add/change features. In this specific case, Skeleton.cs gives clear
openings for any programmer that wanted to change the implementation of the enemy (say in Sprint 5, we want to make the enemy hop instead of walk). Given that this
code also had great readability, it goes to say that it only improves the maintainability of this class. Overall, Skeleton.cs (if not all the enemies) have great
maintainability and will help the group to make changes in the next two sprints.
