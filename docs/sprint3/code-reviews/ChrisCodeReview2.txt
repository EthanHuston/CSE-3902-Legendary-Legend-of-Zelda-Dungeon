Readability:
The variable and method names are easy to understand and each method is simple. 
The only complicated looking method is ConnectRooms since it is long compared to the others but the logic isnâ€™t too difficult to understand and it is well commented to help.
Maintainability:
Maintainability is okay for this class. If we want to add more rooms then we have to change a couple variables and add more connections 
but this is fine because we do not plan on adding more rooms for this project.
